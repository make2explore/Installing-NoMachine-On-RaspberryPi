In this **Tutorial**, We are going to see How to Install NoMachine Remote Desktop Server on Raspberry Pi  

**NoMachine** is a remote access software that allows users to connect to and control remote computers from various devices and operating systems. It is known for its fast and secure remote desktop experience, enabling users to access files, applications, and data as if they were working locally. NoMachine utilizes its own protocol, called NX, to achieve this seamless remote access

**Why NoMachine**  
Benefits of NoMachine for Raspberry Pi compared to other remote desktop software like XRDP and VNC:  
- ***Faster & Smoother***: NoMachine's NX protocol and adaptive compression provide a more responsive experience, especially for graphics and multimedia, compared to the often slower VNC and XRDP.  
- ***Multimedia & Peripherals***: Better support for high-quality audio, video, and USB devices, making it suitable for tasks like watching videos or gaming where VNC and XRDP might struggle.
- ***Cross-Platform & Features***: Offers clients for more platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS) and advanced features like multi-monitor support, file transfer, and session recording, which are limited or absent in other options.
- ***Security***: Built-in security with encryption, SSH tunneling, and multi-factor authentication, making it safer to use, especially over the internet, compared to XRDP which requires manual configuration for secure connections.
- ***Ease of Use***: Generally easier to set up and manage, particularly for users less familiar with Linux configurations
